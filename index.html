					<h2>Food Wastage In India</h2>
					<p class="quote">Throwing away food is like stealing from those who dont have access to it.</p>
					<p class="text">An estimated 931 million tonnes of food, or 17% of total food available to consumers in 2019 globally, went into the waste bins of household, retailers, restaurants and other food services according to the Food Waste Index Report 2021, released by United Nations Environment Programme. The report shows that most of this waste comes from households followed by food services and retail outlets.</p>
					<p class="text">One of the top contributors to food wastage is because of a lack of appropriate planning on the consumer part. Most of the time, food is also wasted because of purchasing or preparing too much. Errors in industrial processing and keeping up with food safety policies. Most restaurants, hotels, and the foodservice industry alike have a tendency of over-preparing/producing food. While the intention is good especially in anticipation of high customer volume and the ability to not running out of the menu, over-preparation often leads to wastage if all the food is unsold. </p>

					<h2>Our Philosophy and Inspiration</h2>
					<p class="quote">Love and Food, both are meant to be shared with all.</p>
					<p class="text">The Empty Bowl provides an interface to the users with leftover food to get in touch with the admin who then provides the food to the needy people hence preventing the food from getting waste.</p>
					<p class="text">We take our inspiration from Feeding India. Feeding India, a non-profit by Zomato, is dedicated towards making India hunger-free. With the help of our NGOs, kitchens and donors, we are moving one step closer to our goal every day. Together, we believe, we can ensure everyone has access to food daily.Feeding India was founded in 2014 by Ankit Kawatra and Srishti Jain, and in January 2019 merged with Zomato to accelerate its progress towards solving hunger in India.</p>
